# SVG Parallax Fjord - Built with Svelte

My first attempt at this site was built with React. Svelte has some great animation centric functionality built into the framework and it works very nicely with SVGs out of the box. I rebuilt the project to get some practice with Svelte and to compare sizes of final output.
